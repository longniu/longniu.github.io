Hi! I am Niu. I am interested in **Web service** and **IoT solution**. *Machine Learning* and *AI* is another domain that excites me. I have a **Ph.D. in Computational Science** from Kobe University, Japan. I love to work on projects that involve systems understanding and analysis. Nothing motivates me better than solving Real life problems. I would like to work with an IT organization that believes in innovation and looks ahead of the curve.
